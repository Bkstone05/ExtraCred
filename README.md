Decrease By One and Conquer - Recursive Max Finder
Overview
This program implements a Decrease By One and Conquer algorithm to find the maximum element in a list. It showcases a recursive max finder that not only computes the maximum value but also demonstrates each step of the algorithm in real-time. This interactive approach helps users understand how the recursive process works.

Features
Step-by-Step Execution: Visualize the algorithm's progression as it recursively evaluates each element in the list.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy to use and understand; suitable for learners who want to grasp the concepts of recursion and algorithms.
Educational Resource: Great for students and educators looking to illustrate recursive algorithms in action.
